### Hello fellow Internet travellers

I am currently a Master's student enrolled in the University of Chicago's Applied Data Science program. Here, you will be able to find a portfolio of the various (and fun!) projects I have completed for school. Note that some of the projects are still in-flight, and will be updated as they progress.
