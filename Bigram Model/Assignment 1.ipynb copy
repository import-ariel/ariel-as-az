      "it was very pleasant when i stayed late in town to launch myself intothe night especially if it was dark and tempestuous and set sail fromsome bright village parlor or lecture room with a bag of rye or indianmeal upon my shoulder for my snug harbor in the woods having made alltight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew ofthoughts leaving only my outer man at the helm or even tying up thehelm when it was plain sailing\n",

      " severaltimes when a visitor chanced to stay into evening and it proved adark night i was obliged to conduct him to the cart-path in the rearof the house and then point out to him the direction he was to pursueand in keeping which he was to be guided rather by his feet than hiseyes\n",
      " one very dark night i directed thus on their way two young menwho had been fishing in the pond\n",

      "i have heard of many going astray even in the village streets when thedarkness was so thick that you could cut it with a knife as the sayingis\n",
      " some who live in the outskirts having come to town a-shopping intheir wagons have been obliged to put up for the night and gentlemenand ladies making a call have gone half a mile out of their wayfeeling the sidewalk only with their feet and not knowing when theyturned\n",
      " it is a surprising and memorable as well as valuableexperience to be lost in the woods any time\n",

      " though he knows thathe has travelled it a thousand times he cannot recognize a feature init but it is as strange to him as if it were a road in siberia\n",
      " bynight of course the perplexity is infinitely greater\n",
      " in our mosttrivial walks we are constantly though unconsciously steering likepilots by certain well-known beacons and headlands and if we go beyondour usual course we still carry in our minds the bearing of someneighboring cape and not till we are completely lost or turnedround—for a man needs only to be turned round once with his eyes shutin this world to be lost—do we appreciate the vastness and strangenessof nature\n",
      " every man has to learn the points of compass again as oftenas he awakes whether from sleep or any abstraction\n",
      " not till we arelost in other words not till we have lost the world do we begin tofind ourselves and realize where we are and the infinite extent of ourrelations\n",
      "one afternoon near the end of the first summer when i went to thevillage to get a shoe from the cobbler’s i was seized and put intojail because as i have elsewhere related i did not pay a tax to orrecognize the authority of the state which buys and sells men womenand children like cattle at the door of its senate-house\n",

      " a huckleberry never reaches boston they have not beenknown there since they grew on her three hills\n",

      " as long as eternaljustice reigns not one innocent huckleberry can be transported thitherfrom the country’s hills\n",
      "occasionally after my hoeing was done for the day i joined someimpatient companion who had been fishing on the pond since morning assilent and motionless as a duck or a floating leaf and afterpractising various kinds of philosophy had concluded commonly by thetime i arrived that he belonged to the ancient sect of cœnobites\n",
      "there was one older man an excellent fisher and skilled in all kindsof woodcraft who was pleased to look upon my house as a buildingerected for the convenience of fishermen and i was equally pleasedwhen he sat in my doorway to arrange his lines\n",
      " once in a while we sattogether on the pond he at one end of the boat and i at the otherbut not many words passed between us for he had grown deaf in hislater years but he occasionally hummed a psalm which harmonized wellenough with my philosophy\n",
      " our intercourse was thus altogether one ofunbroken harmony far more pleasing to remember than if it had beencarried on by speech\n",
      " when as was commonly the case i had none tocommune with i used to raise the echoes by striking with a paddle onthe side of my boat filling the surrounding woods with circling anddilating sound stirring them up as the keeper of a menagerie his wildbeasts until i elicited a growl from every wooded vale and hill-side\n",
      "in warm evenings i frequently sat in the boat playing the flute andsaw the perch which i seemed to have charmed hovering around me andthe moon travelling over the ribbed bottom which was strewed with thewrecks of the forest\n",
      " formerly i had come to this pond adventurouslyfrom time to time in dark summer nights with a companion and makinga fire close to the water’s edge which we thought attracted thefishes we caught pouts with a bunch of worms strung on a thread andwhen we had done far in the night threw the burning brands high intothe air like skyrockets which coming down into the pond werequenched with a loud hissing and we were suddenly groping in totaldarkness\n",
      " through this whistling a tune we took our way to the hauntsof men again\n",
      " but now i had made my home by the shore\n",
      "sometimes after staying in a village parlor till the family had allretired i have returned to the woods and partly with a view to thenext day’s dinner spent the hours of midnight fishing from a boat bymoonlight serenaded by owls and foxes and hearing from time to timethe creaking note of some unknown bird close at hand\n",
      " these experienceswere very memorable and valuable to me—anchored in forty feet ofwater and twenty or thirty rods from the shore surrounded sometimesby thousands of small perch and shiners dimpling the surface withtheir tails in the moonlight and communicating by a long flaxen linewith mysterious nocturnal fishes which had their dwelling forty feetbelow or sometimes dragging sixty feet of line about the pond as idrifted in the gentle night breeze now and then feeling a slightvibration along it indicative of some life prowling about itsextremity of dull uncertain blundering purpose there and slow to makeup its mind\n",
      " at length you slowly raise pulling hand over hand somehorned pout squeaking and squirming to the upper air\n",
      " it was veryqueer especially in dark nights when your thoughts had wandered tovast and cosmogonal themes in other spheres to feel this faint jerkwhich came to interrupt your dreams and link you to nature again\n",

      "the scenery of walden is on a humble scale and though very beautifuldoes not approach to grandeur nor can it much concern one who has notlong frequented it or lived by its shore yet this pond is soremarkable for its depth and purity as to merit a particulardescription\n",

      " in some lights viewed even from ahill-top it is of a vivid green next the shore\n",
      " some have referredthis to the reflection of the verdure but it is equally green thereagainst the railroad sand-bank and in the spring before the leavesare expanded and it may be simply the result of the prevailing bluemixed with the yellow of the sand\n",
      " such is the color of its iris\n",

      " it is a vitreous greenish blue as iremember it like those patches of the winter sky seen through cloudvistas in the west before sundown\n",

      " once in the winter many years ago when i hadbeen cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel as istepped ashore i tossed my axe back on to the ice but as if some evilgenius had directed it it slid four or five rods directly into one ofthe holes where the water was twenty-five feet deep\n",
      " out of curiosityi lay down on the ice and looked through the hole until i saw the axea little on one side standing on its head with its helve erect andgently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond and there itmight have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time thehandle rotted off if i had not disturbed it\n",

      "the shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones likepaving stones excepting one or two short sand beaches and is so steepthat in many places a single leap will carry you into water over yourhead and were it not for its remarkable transparency that would bethe last to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the opposite side\n",

      " as forthe stones many still think that they are hardly to be accounted forby the action of the waves on these hills but i observe that thesurrounding hills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones sothat they have been obliged to pile them up in walls on both sides ofthe railroad cut nearest the pond and moreover there are most stoneswhere the shore is most abrupt so that unfortunately it is no longera mystery to me\n",

      " the hunters were formerly a numerous andmerry crew here\n",

      "at midnight when there was a moon i sometimes met with hounds in mypath prowling about the woods which would skulk out of my way as ifafraid and stand silent amid the bushes till i had passed\n",

      " there werescores of pitch-pines around my house from one to four inches indiameter which had been gnawed by mice the previous winter—anorwegian winter for them for the snow lay long and deep and theywere obliged to mix a large proportion of pine bark with their otherdiet\n",
      " these trees were alive and apparently flourishing at mid-summerand many of them had grown a foot though completely girdled but afteranother winter such were without exception dead\n",
      " it is remarkable thata single mouse should thus be allowed a whole pine tree for its dinnergnawing round instead of up and down it but perhaps it is necessary inorder to thin these trees which are wont to grow up densely\n",
      "the hares (_lepus americanus_) were very familiar\n",
      " one had her formunder my house all winter separated from me only by the flooring andshe startled me each morning by her hasty departure when i began tostir—thump thump thump striking her head against the floor timbersin her hurry\n",

      " like the marmots in the surroundinghills it closes its eye-lids and becomes dormant for three months ormore\n",
      " standing on the snow-covered plain as if in a pasture amid thehills i cut my way first through a foot of snow and then a foot ofice and open a window under my feet where kneeling to drink i lookdown into the quiet parlor of the fishes pervaded by a softened lightas through a window of ground glass with its bright sanded floor thesame as in summer there a perennial waveless serenity reigns as in theamber twilight sky corresponding to the cool and even temperament ofthe inhabitants\n",

      " they sit and eat theirluncheon in stout fear-naughts on the dry oak leaves on the shore aswise in natural lore as the citizen is in artificial\n",
      " they neverconsulted with books and know and can tell much less than they havedone\n",

      " the perch swallows the grub-worm thepickerel swallows the perch and the fisher-man swallows the pickereland so all the chinks in the scale of being are filled\n",
      "when i strolled around the pond in misty weather i was sometimes amusedby the primitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted\n",
      " he wouldperhaps have placed alder branches over the narrow holes in the icewhich were four or five rods apart and an equal distance from theshore and having fastened the end of the line to a stick to preventits being pulled through have passed the slack line over a twig of thealder a foot or more above the ice and tied a dry oak leaf to itwhich being pulled down would show when he had a bite\n",
      " these aldersloomed through the mist at regular intervals as you walked half wayround the pond\n",
      "ah the pickerel of walden\n",
      " when i see them lying on the ice or in thewell which the fisherman cuts in the ice making a little hole to admitthe water i am always surprised by their rare beauty as if they werefabulous fishes they are so foreign to the streets even to the woodsforeign as arabia to our concord life\n",
      " they possess a quite dazzlingand transcendent beauty which separates them by a wide interval fromthe cadaverous cod and haddock whose fame is trumpeted in our streets\n",
      "they are not green like the pines nor gray like the stones nor bluelike the sky but they have to my eyes if possible yet rarer colorslike flowers and precious stones as if they were the pearls theanimalized _nuclei_ or crystals of the walden water\n",
      " they of courseare walden all over and all through are themselves small waldens inthe animal kingdom waldenses\n",
      " it is surprising that they are caughthere—that in this deep and capacious spring far beneath the rattlingteams and chaises and tinkling sleighs that travel the walden roadthis great gold and emerald fish swims\n",
      " i never chanced to see its kindin any market it would be the cynosure of all eyes there\n",
      " easily witha few convulsive quirks they give up their watery ghosts like amortal translated before his time to the thin air of heaven\n",
      "walden_pond_mapas i was desirous to recover the long lost bottom of walden pond isurveyed it carefully before the ice broke up early in ’46 withcompass and chain and sounding line\n",
      " there have been many stories toldabout the bottom or rather no bottom of this pond which certainlyhad no foundation for themselves\n",
      " it is remarkable how long men willbelieve in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble tosound it\n",
      " i have visited two such bottomless ponds in one walk in thisneighborhood\n",
      " many have believed that walden reached quite through tothe other side of the globe\n",
      " some who have lain flat on the ice for along time looking down through the illusive medium perchance withwatery eyes into the bargain and driven to hasty conclusions by thefear of catching cold in their breasts have seen vast holes “intowhich a load of hay might be driven” if there were any body to driveit the undoubted source of the styx and entrance to the infernalregions from these parts\n",
      " others have gone down from the village with a“fifty-six” and a wagon load of inch rope but yet have failed to findany bottom for while the “fifty-six” was resting by the way they werepaying out the rope in the vain attempt to fathom their trulyimmeasurable capacity for marvellousness\n",
      " but i can assure my readersthat walden has a reasonably tight bottom at a not unreasonable thoughat an unusual depth\n",
      " i fathomed it easily with a cod-line and a stoneweighing about a pound and a half and could tell accurately when thestone left the bottom by having to pull so much harder before thewater got underneath to help me\n",
      " the greatest depth was exactly onehundred and two feet to which may be added the five feet which it hasrisen since making one hundred and seven\n",
      " this is a remarkable depthfor so small an area yet not an inch of it can be spared by theimagination\n",
      " what if all ponds were shallow\n",
      " would it not react on theminds of men\n",
      " i am thankful that this pond was made deep and pure for asymbol\n",
      " while men believe in the infinite some ponds will be thought tobe bottomless\n",
      "a factory owner hearing what depth i had found thought that it couldnot be true for judging from his acquaintance with dams sand wouldnot lie at so steep an angle\n",
      " but the deepest ponds are not so deep inproportion to their area as most suppose and if drained would notleave very remarkable valleys\n",
      " they are not like cups between thehills for this one which is so unusually deep for its area appearsin a vertical section through its centre not deeper than a shallowplate\n",
      " most ponds emptied would leave a meadow no more hollow than wefrequently see\n",
      " william gilpin who is so admirable in all that relatesto landscapes and usually so correct standing at the head of lochfyne in scotland which he describes as “a bay of salt water sixty orseventy fathoms deep four miles in breadth” and about fifty mileslong surrounded by mountains observes “if we could have seen itimmediately after the diluvian crash or whatever convulsion of natureoccasioned it before the waters gushed in what a horrid chasm must ithave appeared\n",
      "     so high as heaved the tumid hills so low     down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep     capacious bed of waters—\n",
      "”but if using the shortest diameter of loch fyne we apply theseproportions to walden which as we have seen appears already in avertical section only like a shallow plate it will appear four timesas shallow\n",
      " so much for the _increased_ horrors of the chasm of lochfyne when emptied\n",
      " no doubt many a smiling valley with its stretchingcornfields occupies exactly such a “horrid chasm” from which thewaters have receded though it requires the insight and the far sightof the geologist to convince the unsuspecting inhabitants of this fact\n",
      "often an inquisitive eye may detect the shores of a primitive lake inthe low horizon hills and no subsequent elevation of the plain hasbeen necessary to conceal their history\n",
      " but it is easiest as they whowork on the highways know to find the hollows by the puddles after ashower\n",
      " the amount of it is the imagination give it the least licensedives deeper and soars higher than nature goes\n",
      " so probably the depthof the ocean will be found to be very inconsiderable compared with itsbreadth\n",
      "as i sounded through the ice i could determine the shape of the bottomwith greater accuracy than is possible in surveying harbors which donot freeze over and i was surprised at its general regularity\n",
      " in thedeepest part there are several acres more level than almost any fieldwhich is exposed to the sun wind and plough\n",
      " in one instance on a linearbitrarily chosen the depth did not vary more than one foot in thirtyrods and generally near the middle i could calculate the variationfor each one hundred feet in any direction beforehand within three orfour inches\n",
      " some are accustomed to speak of deep and dangerous holeseven in quiet sandy ponds like this but the effect of water underthese circumstances is to level all inequalities\n",
      " the regularity of thebottom and its conformity to the shores and the range of theneighboring hills were so perfect that a distant promontory betrayeditself in the soundings quite across the pond and its direction couldbe determined by observing the opposite shore\n",
      " cape becomes bar andplain shoal and valley and gorge deep water and channel\n",
      "when i had mapped the pond by the scale of ten rods to an inch and putdown the soundings more than a hundred in all i observed thisremarkable coincidence\n",
      " having noticed that the number indicating thegreatest depth was apparently in the centre of the map i laid a ruleon the map lengthwise and then breadthwise and found to my surprisethat the line of greatest length intersected the line of greatestbreadth _exactly_ at the point of greatest depth notwithstanding thatthe middle is so nearly level the outline of the pond far fromregular and the extreme length and breadth were got by measuring intothe coves and i said to myself who knows but this hint would conductto the deepest part of the ocean as well as of a pond or puddle\n",
      " is notthis the rule also for the height of mountains regarded as theopposite of valleys\n",
      " we know that a hill is not highest at itsnarrowest part\n",
      "of five coves three or all which had been sounded were observed tohave a bar quite across their mouths and deeper water within so thatthe bay tended to be an expansion of water within the land not onlyhorizontally but vertically and to form a basin or independent pondthe direction of the two capes showing the course of the bar\n",
      " everyharbor on the sea-coast also has its bar at its entrance\n",
      " inproportion as the mouth of the cove was wider compared with its lengththe water over the bar was deeper compared with that in the basin\n",
      "given then the length and breadth of the cove and the character ofthe surrounding shore and you have almost elements enough to make outa formula for all cases\n",
      "in order to see how nearly i could guess with this experience at thedeepest point in a pond by observing the outlines of its surface andthe character of its shores alone i made a plan of white pond whichcontains about forty-one acres and like this has no island in itnor any visible inlet or outlet and as the line of greatest breadthfell very near the line of least breadth where two opposite capesapproached each other and two opposite bays receded i ventured to marka point a short distance from the latter line but still on the line ofgreatest length as the deepest\n",
      " the deepest part was found to bewithin one hundred feet of this still farther in the direction towhich i had inclined and was only one foot deeper namely sixty feet\n",
      "of course a stream running through or an island in the pond wouldmake the problem much more complicated\n",
      "if we knew all the laws of nature we should need only one fact or thedescription of one actual phenomenon to infer all the particularresults at that point\n",
      " now we know only a few laws and our result isvitiated not of course by any confusion or irregularity in naturebut by our ignorance of essential elements in the calculation\n",
      " ournotions of law and harmony are commonly confined to those instanceswhich we detect but the harmony which results from a far greaternumber of seemingly conflicting but really concurring laws which wehave not detected is still more wonderful\n",
      " the particular laws are asour points of view as to the traveller a mountain outline varieswith every step and it has an infinite number of profiles thoughabsolutely but one form\n",
      " even when cleft or bored through it is notcomprehended in its entireness\n",
      "what i have observed of the pond is no less true in ethics\n",
      " it is thelaw of average\n",
      " such a rule of the two diameters not only guides ustoward the sun in the system and the heart in man but draw linesthrough the length and breadth of the aggregate of a man’s particulardaily behaviors and waves of life into his coves and inlets and wherethey intersect will be the height or depth of his character\n",
      " perhaps weneed only to know how his shores trend and his adjacent country orcircumstances to infer his depth and concealed bottom\n",
      " if he issurrounded by mountainous circumstances an achillean shore whosepeaks overshadow and are reflected in his bosom they suggest acorresponding depth in him\n",
      " but a low and smooth shore proves himshallow on that side\n",
      " in our bodies a bold projecting brow falls offto and indicates a corresponding depth of thought\n",
      " also there is a baracross the entrance of our every cove or particular inclination eachis our harbor for a season in which we are detained and partiallyland-locked\n",
      " these inclinations are not whimsical usually but theirform size and direction are determined by the promontories of theshore the ancient axes of elevation\n",
      " when this bar is graduallyincreased by storms tides or currents or there is a subsidence ofthe waters so that it reaches to the surface that which was at firstbut an inclination in the shore in which a thought was harbored becomesan individual lake cut off from the ocean wherein the thought securesits own conditions changes perhaps from salt to fresh becomes asweet sea dead sea or a marsh\n",
      " at the advent of each individual intothis life may we not suppose that such a bar has risen to the surfacesomewhere\n",
      " it is true we are such poor navigators that our thoughtsfor the most part stand off and on upon a harborless coast areconversant only with the bights of the bays of poesy or steer for thepublic ports of entry and go into the dry docks of science where theymerely refit for this world and no natural currents concur toindividualize them\n",
      "as for the inlet or outlet of walden i have not discovered any butrain and snow and evaporation though perhaps with a thermometer and aline such places may be found for where the water flows into the pondit will probably be coldest in summer and warmest in winter\n",
      " when theice-men were at work here in ’46–7 the cakes sent to the shore wereone day rejected by those who were stacking them up there not beingthick enough to lie side by side with the rest and the cutters thusdiscovered that the ice over a small space was two or three inchesthinner than elsewhere which made them think that there was an inletthere\n",
      " they also showed me in another place what they thought was a“leach hole” through which the pond leaked out under a hill into aneighboring meadow pushing me out on a cake of ice to see it\n",
      " it was asmall cavity under ten feet of water but i think that i can warrantthe pond not to need soldering till they find a worse leak than that\n",
      "one has suggested that if such a “leach hole” should be found itsconnection with the meadow if any existed might be proved byconveying some colored powder or sawdust to the mouth of the hole andthen putting a strainer over the spring in the meadow which wouldcatch some of the particles carried through by the current\n",
      "while i was surveying the ice which was sixteen inches thickundulated under a slight wind like water\n",
      " it is well known that a levelcannot be used on ice\n",
      " at one rod from the shore its greatestfluctuation when observed by means of a level on land directed towarda graduated staff on the ice was three quarters of an inch though theice appeared firmly attached to the shore\n",
      " it was probably greater inthe middle\n",
      " who knows but if our instruments were delicate enough wemight detect an undulation in the crust of the earth\n",
      " when two legs ofmy level were on the shore and the third on the ice and the sightswere directed over the latter a rise or fall of the ice of an almostinfinitesimal amount made a difference of several feet on a tree acrossthe pond\n",
      " when i began to cut holes for sounding there were three orfour inches of water on the ice under a deep snow which had sunk itthus far but the water began immediately to run into these holes andcontinued to run for two days in deep streams which wore away the iceon every side and contributed essentially if not mainly to dry thesurface of the pond for as the water ran in it raised and floatedthe ice\n",
      " this was somewhat like cutting a hole in the bottom of a shipto let the water out\n",
      " when such holes freeze and a rain succeeds andfinally a new freezing forms a fresh smooth ice over all it isbeautifully mottled internally by dark figures shaped somewhat like aspider’s web what you may call ice rosettes produced by the channelsworn by the water flowing from all sides to a centre\n",
      " sometimes alsowhen the ice was covered with shallow puddles i saw a double shadow ofmyself one standing on the head of the other one on the ice theother on the trees or hill-side\n",
      "while yet it is cold january and snow and ice are thick and solid theprudent landlord comes from the village to get ice to cool his summerdrink impressively even pathetically wise to foresee the heat andthirst of july now in january—wearing a thick coat and mittens\n",
      " whenso many things are not provided for\n",
      " it may be that he lays up notreasures in this world which will cool his summer drink in the next\n",
      "he cuts and saws the solid pond unroofs the house of fishes and cartsoff their very element and air held fast by chains and stakes likecorded wood through the favoring winter air to wintry cellars tounderlie the summer there\n",
      " it looks like solidified azure as far offit is drawn through the streets\n",
      " these ice-cutters are a merry racefull of jest and sport and when i went among them they were wont toinvite me to saw pit-fashion with them i standing underneath\n",
      "in the winter of ’46–7 there came a hundred men of hyperboreanextraction swoop down on to our pond one morning with many car-loadsof ungainly-looking farming tools sleds ploughs drill-barrowsturf-knives spades saws rakes and each man was armed with adouble-pointed pike-staff such as is not described in the new-englandfarmer or the cultivator\n",
      " i did not know whether they had come to sow acrop of winter rye or some other kind of grain recently introducedfrom iceland\n",
      " as i saw no manure i judged that they meant to skim theland as i had done thinking the soil was deep and had lain fallowlong enough\n",
      " they said that a gentleman farmer who was behind thescenes wanted to double his money which as i understood amounted tohalf a million already but in order to cover each one of his dollarswith another he took off the only coat ay the skin itself of waldenpond in the midst of a hard winter\n",
      " they went to work at onceploughing harrowing rolling furrowing in admirable order as ifthey were bent on making this a model farm but when i was lookingsharp to see what kind of seed they dropped into the furrow a gang offellows by my side suddenly began to hook up the virgin mould itselfwith a peculiar jerk clean down to the sand or rather the water—forit was a very springy soil—indeed all the _terra firma_ there was—andhaul it away on sleds and then i guessed that they must be cuttingpeat in a bog\n",
      " so they came and went every day with a peculiar shriekfrom the locomotive from and to some point of the polar regions as itseemed to me like a flock of arctic snow-birds\n",
      " but sometimes squawwalden had her revenge and a hired man walking behind his teamslipped through a crack in the ground down toward tartarus and he whowas so brave before suddenly became but the ninth part of a man almostgave up his animal heat and was glad to take refuge in my house andacknowledged that there was some virtue in a stove or sometimes thefrozen soil took a piece of steel out of a ploughshare or a plough gotset in the furrow and had to be cut out\n",
      "to speak literally a hundred irishmen with yankee overseers camefrom cambridge every day to get out the ice\n",
      " they divided it into cakesby methods too well known to require description and these beingsledded to the shore were rapidly hauled off on to an ice platformand raised by grappling irons and block and tackle worked by horseson to a stack as surely as so many barrels of flour and there placedevenly side by side and row upon row as if they formed the solid baseof an obelisk designed to pierce the clouds\n",
      " they told me that in agood day they could get out a thousand tons which was the yield ofabout one acre\n",
      " deep ruts and “cradle holes” were worn in the ice ason _terra firma_ by the passage of the sleds over the same track andthe horses invariably ate their oats out of cakes of ice hollowed outlike buckets\n",
      " they stacked up the cakes thus in the open air in a pilethirty-five feet high on one side and six or seven rods square puttinghay between the outside layers to exclude the air for when the windthough never so cold finds a passage through it will wear largecavities leaving slight supports or studs only here and there andfinally topple it down\n",
      " at first it looked like a vast blue fort orvalhalla but when they began to tuck the coarse meadow hay into thecrevices and this became covered with rime and icicles it looked likea venerable moss-grown and hoary ruin built of azure-tinted marblethe abode of winter that old man we see in the almanac—his shanty asif he had a design to estivate with us\n",
      " they calculated that nottwenty-five per cent of this would reach its destination and that twoor three per cent would be wasted in the cars\n",
      " however a still greaterpart of this heap had a different destiny from what was intended foreither because the ice was found not to keep so well as was expectedcontaining more air than usual or for some other reason it never gotto market\n",
      " this heap made in the winter of ’46–7 and estimated tocontain ten thousand tons was finally covered with hay and boards andthough it was unroofed the following july and a part of it carriedoff the rest remaining exposed to the sun it stood over that summerand the next winter and was not quite melted till september 1848\n",
      " thusthe pond recovered the greater part\n",
      "like the water the walden ice seen near at hand has a green tintbut at a distance is beautifully blue and you can easily tell it fromthe white ice of the river or the merely greenish ice of some ponds aquarter of a mile off\n",
      " sometimes one of those great cakes slips fromthe ice-man’s sled into the village street and lies there for a weeklike a great emerald an object of interest to all passers\n",
      " i havenoticed that a portion of walden which in the state of water was greenwill often when frozen appear from the same point of view blue\n",
      " sothe hollows about this pond will sometimes in the winter be filledwith a greenish water somewhat like its own but the next day will havefrozen blue\n",
      " perhaps the blue color of water and ice is due to thelight and air they contain and the most transparent is the bluest\n",
      " iceis an interesting subject for contemplation\n",
      " they told me that they hadsome in the ice-houses at fresh pond five years old which was as goodas ever\n",
